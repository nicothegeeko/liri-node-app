# HW liri-node-app

# App Description: 

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives back data based on said parameters.

# Requirements
* Use Command Line arguments and npm packages in node.js to: 
	* Display Latest Tweets (20);
	* Get specific songs from spotify;
	* Get movie info from IMDB; 

Technologies Used

* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Node Package Manager
* Twitter NPM
* Spotify NPM
* OMDB API

Code Explaination
* Used and required several NPM packages to access information from twitter, spotify, and OMDB. Also connected Twitter account to display tweets by getting keys from Twitter developer. By inputing commands that include:  * `my-tweets`  * `spotify-this-song` * `movie-this` * `do-what-it-says`. The user is able to retrieve information from Twitter, Spotify, and OMDB displayed in the command terminal. As a bonus I attempted to print the data returned in the log.txt but ran into issues and will revisit this implementation at a later time.
